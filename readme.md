There's practically no unique identification on this unit, but it's a pretty common/generic design.
There are several sellers that offer this unit so it's hard to say who the original manufacturer is.
All of the listings feature an image like this:

## Datasheet

I ordered a pH/ORP sensor, but there seller sent me the [datasheet](_docs/pH_EC%20Sensor.pdf) for the pH/EC variant.
I am pretty sure that the internals are basically the same and it's just the software/probe that's different.

In any case, the modbus / protocol data from the attached datasheet works for me with my pH/ORP sensor.

## Sample code

Using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or another virtual environment manager, install the dependencies and then run the script.

## Teardown

Nothing about the unit is particularly difficult to access so this is a pretty straight forward teardown.
The unit is held together with some hot snot and a few philips screws.

The unit sips power.
Depending on which source you consult, the unit supports between 7 and 24V but I was able to power it with 5V.

Label tells you everything _except_ who the manufacturer is.

Beyond that, just philips screws holding the unit together.

Front panel isn't anything special.

The main PCB seems designed to accommodate a few different sensors as there are a few unpopulated headers / footprints.

There's a STM32 clone running the show.
Almost certainly the 4 pins next to it are a UART/Programming header.
No, I didn't try to connect to it.
